# BrainSort
A simple Xamarin Forms app that replicates some functions that my younger brother's brain automatically performs on strings.

My younger brother has an interesting brain skill: he automatically and instantly sorts and counts the numbers of letters in a word or phrase. So, if you give him a phrase like, "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog", he can instantly tell you:
1) All the letters in alphabetical order: ABCDEEEFGHHIJKLMNOOOOPQRRSTTUUVWXYZ
2) All the letters in reverse alphabetical order: ZYXWVUUTTSRRQPOOOONMLKJIHHFEEEDCBA
3) The total number of letters: 35

I slapped together this simple app in order to quickly verify the results his brain produces. He says that he chunks the phrase into groups of 4, and that 16 is the golden number of letters that his brain perfers. So the app will display the letter count in orange for multiples of 4, and green for multiples of 16.
